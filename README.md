## Draft

* 

## Abstract

**Title:** "@container queries in React"

* The problem: in the advent of reusable components, we should be able to
  conditionally apply styling based on the space available to a given component.
* Idea: `@container` queries in CSS, applied with a JS runtime.
* Introducing `react-container-query`, example (Gifs / Videos).
* Talk about the current WICG efforts to create a spec for browsers.
* Before it's standardized: ResizeObserver, Houdini.
* Mention other libs, polyfills and size-aware react component.

## Prepare for Questions

* Does it work with CSS-in-JS solutions?
* Performance?
* SSR?
* Does it work in non-react environments?
* Does it work with vue.js? Other component libs?
